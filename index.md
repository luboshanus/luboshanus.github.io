## About Me

I am a Ph.D student in Economics at IES FSV UK at Charles University under the supervision of [Lukáš Vácha](https://www.utia.cas.cz/cs/people/vacha) and [Jozef Baruník](https://barunik.github.io). My research interests are mainly in both macroeconomics and financial time series analysis. Particularly, the interest focuses on estimation methods, dependence of time series in various dimensions, and machine learning.

I am also a researcher at Institute of Information Theory and Automation at the Czech Academy of Sciences, where I work on various projects.

## Research Interests

- **Time-series:** time-variation, persistence, quantiles
- **Machine Learning:** neural networks, classification, distributions, trees
