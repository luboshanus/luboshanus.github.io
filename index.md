## Short Bio

I am a lecturer at the Institute of Economic Studies at Charles University (IES FSV UK) and I am also a researcher (postdoc) at Institute of Information Theory and Automation at the Czech Academy of Sciences (UTIA), where I work on various projects.

My research interests are mainly in both macroeconomics and financial time series analysis. Particularly, the interest focuses on estimation methods, dependence of time series in various dimensions, and machine learning.

<!-- I did my PhD under the supervision of [Lukáš Vácha](https://www.utia.cas.cz/cs/people/vacha) and [Jozef Baruník](https://barunik.github.io) ath the IES. -->

### Research interests

- **Time-series:** time-variation, persistence, quantiles
